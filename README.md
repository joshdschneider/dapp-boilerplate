# dapp-boilerplate

Web app boilerplate equipped with methods for web3 authentication. Connect your wallet via MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, or Fortmatic. Built with Next.js and Typescript. Custom hooks and context. Featuring eager connection detection and session management (stays connected across tabs). *There are lots of great resources out there* (like [web3-react](http://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react)), but I wanted to do the integrations from scratch to understand how it all works.
